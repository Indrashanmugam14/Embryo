Fetal Health Classification using Machine Learning

1. This project is a machine learning-based analysis and classification model that predicts the health status of a fetus based on various cardiotocographic (CTG) features.
2. The goal is to assist medical professionals in identifying potential fetal health issues early using predictive analytics.

üß† Problem Statement

Accurate classification of fetal health status is essential to reduce risks during pregnancy and labor. This project utilizes the Fetal Health dataset to classify fetal states into:
- Normal
- Suspect
- Pathological

üìä Dataset

The dataset includes cardiotocogram (CTG) features extracted from fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) signals. Key features:
- Baseline value
- Accelerations
- Fetal movement
- Uterine contractions
- Abnormal short-term variability etc

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM
  
üìà Model Evaluation

Metrics used for evaluating model performance:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve (if applied)
